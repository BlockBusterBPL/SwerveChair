# Technodogs Swerve Chair

This is the code for the Brighton High School Technodogs "Swerve Chair"
The code is based on the swerve drive math that is used on our 2021 FRC robot. All non-essential code has been removed, so that the robot is significantly simpler. The code is also designed to use swerve modules from our robot, which means that old, used swerve drive modules can be reused to make an epic driving chair.
